metrics to monitor:
server general metrics :

Sever running state

CPU,CPU used,CPU load,CPU temperature,Memeroy usage,I/O,Disk space usage,IO read, IO write,Network,Network traffic,TCP connection states

application metrics :

SSL certificate validate status

to monitor metrics:
we used monitor Platform zabbix


challenges of monitoring
1.Figure out important metrics to monitor

2.Metrics monitoring tool should not effect the server's performance. When use script method to monitor,history performance value storaging is very time consuming(read and write file)

3.Set proper trigger warning value to minimize false alarm.
